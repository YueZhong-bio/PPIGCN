# PPIGCN
Predicting the protein-protein interaction with GCN model

Here are the data and code we used for the project of predicting PPI.

(1) The 'PPIGCN.py' is PPIGCN model;

(2) The 'protein.dictionary.tsv' and 'protein.actions.tsv' are the PPI data

If you have any questions about the code, please contact us.
Thanks~ :)
